# iRF simulations and data analysis
This repository contains scripts to run the simulations and analyses described
in *iterative Random Forests to discover predictive and stable high-order
interactions*. Data for the analyses are included as supporting files.

* `enhancer.R`: R script used to run `iRF` on the enhancer data.
* `splicing.R`: R script used to run `iRF` on the splicing data.
* `simulations/booleanSimulations.R`: R script used to run `iRF` on simulated
  data using the boolean generative modesl described in the paper.
* `simulations/enhancerSimulations.R`: R script used to run `iRF` on simulated
  enhancer data as described in the paper.
